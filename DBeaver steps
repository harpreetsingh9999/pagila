    returned_rentals INTEGER
    );"

8. Installed dblink by using "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS dblink;"

    "INSERT INTO weekly_outstanding_rentals (week_beginning, outstanding_rentals, returned_rentals)
    SELECT
    Cast(date_trunc('week', rental_date) as date) AS week_beginning,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE return_date IS NULL) AS outstanding_rentals,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE return_date IS NOT NULL) AS returned_rentals
    FROM
    dblink('dbname=pagila', 'SELECT rental_date, return_date FROM rental') 
    AS t(rental_date TIMESTAMP, return_date TIMESTAMP)
    GROUP BY 1
